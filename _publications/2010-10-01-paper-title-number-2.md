excerpt: 'Immersive sports are emerging recently after the metaverse hype. This paper investigates an immersive setup that leverages virtual reality to recreate the kinetic and sensory nuances of dragon boating. We employ a body-centric approach to enable users to engage with authentic paddling actions, e.g., mobilising iron sticks on the boat with reasonably emulated water resistance. The virtual environments mirror real-world scenes, e.g., Pearl River (Guangdong). We employed multi-modal experiences to replicate the visuals and tactile, kinesthetic, and environmental intricacies of dragon boating. Our Dragon Boat simulator serves as a groundwork for redefining the boundaries of immersive sports training that bridges the gap between virtuality and the real world.'
